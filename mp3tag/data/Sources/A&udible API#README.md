I've tried to be as compatible to the existing Audible Tag Sources as possible. Let me know if there is something missing or can be changed to improve compatibility with existing systems.

## Configuration Settings

### Add narrator to artist
If enabled, the narrator is added to the artist field.

### Add single album artist only
If enabled and the audiobook has multiple artists, only the first artist is added to the `ALBUMARTIST` field and the complete list of artists is stored in `ALBUMARTISTS`.

### Add single genre only
If enabled and the audiobook has multiple genres, only the first genre is added to the `GENRE` field and `TMP_GENRE1` and `TMP_GENRE2` have additional genres.

### Use full release date as year
If enabled, the full release date `YYYY-MM-DD` is used for the year field (otherwise it's `YYYY` only).

### Delimiter for multiple values
The string to use as a delimiter for multiple genres.
